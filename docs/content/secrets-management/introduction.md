# Introduction to Secrets

Kubernetes Secrets let you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys. Storing confidential information in a secret is safer and more flexible than putting it verbatim in a pod definition or in a container image.

Secrets can contain user credentials required by pods to access a database. For example, a database connection string consists of a username and password. You can store the username in a file `./username.txt` and the password in a file `./password.txt` on your local machine.

```sh
# Create files needed for the rest of the example
echo -n 'admin' > ./username.txt
echo -n '1f2d1e2e67df' > ./password.txt
```

```sh
kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass --from-file=./username.txt --from-file=./password.txt
```

## Kubernetes secrets

There are two ways for storing secrets in Kubernetes resources:

* Base64 decode your values and create a secret:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: mysecret
    type: Opaque
    data:
      config.yaml: |-
        apiUrl: "YXBpLmNvbQo="  # base64 for api.com
        username: YWRtaW4K      # base64 for admin
        password: cGFzc3dvcmQK  # base64 for password
    ```

* Use string data with literal values to create secret:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: mysecret
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
      config.yaml: |-
        apiUrl: "https://my.api.com/api/v1"
        username: admin
        password: password
    ```

## Limitations of Kubernetes secrets

1. They are not encrypted at rest
1. By default, cluster admins can see all the secrets of all the tenants
1. When in use (i.e. mounted as `tempfs` in the node that runs the pod that is using them), they can be seen by a node administrator
1. When in use, they can be seen by anyone who has the ability to remote shell into the container
1. Can not store Kubernetes secrets in Git repo as anyone can decode them

So to handle this case, we need some other tool to handle this.

SAAP offers two different managed solutions for consuming secrets in more secure fashion:

1. [Vault](vault.md)
1. [Sealed Secrets](sealed-secrets.md)
